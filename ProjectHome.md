Release is a media streaming service developed to facilitate the delivery of e-learning material in a more reliable and user friendly way. Using YouTube as a proven example of what works it converts audio & video files into a smaller compatible format and presents them within a web browser.

However where-as YouTube is all about sharing your content, Release is aimed at restricting access so that only the people you want to see it have access. By default content is not searchable, allowing you to give access to students by linking to it from within an existing Learning Environment.
Access can be restircted further by requiring users to login or giving only certain users. (it should be integrated into you existing LDAP login system).

Release also trys to change the focus of the e-learning material. Instead of embedding a video into your e-learning material Release allows you to embed e-learning material around your video, allowing you to add learning outcomes, simple quizzes, and additional descriptions to the video creating it as a whole activity rather than just a video.

Currently being piloted at University of Worcester I hope to release the source code soon. Please contact me for further information.
